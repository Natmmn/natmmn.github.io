     <h1>Processing</h1>

     <p>Artist Statement: I am a beginner to Java Script and processing in general so this project was very stressfull
     and time consuming. As a newbie I did not know how to make curves, thus I created a very geometric portrait of myself.
     This portrait took a while to create because it was more of a "learn as you go" project. In the end I believe that my
     processing looks very musch like me, not the picture I tried to copy, but me in general.
