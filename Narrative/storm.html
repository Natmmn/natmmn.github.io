 <p>You stormed inside the hideout waving your sword in the air. The Wizard's
 	dragon spotted you and alerted the Wizard. *POOF* The Wizard appeared infront
 	of you angry. Before you could think, he cast a paralyzing spell on you 
 	and wiped your memory about the mission to the save the Princess.  He then
 	sent you on your way back to the Kingdom with a map. The End.
