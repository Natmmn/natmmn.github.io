 <p>You open the door revealing The Princess dressed in all white. You tell
 her that you are here to save her from the wretched Evil Wizard, but she frowns
 and tells you that she was never kidnapped. She ran away because her and the Wizard
 fell in love and wanted to get married. Today is their wedding day, too bad it was 
 not yours. You go back to the Kingdom and tell The King that you never found his
 daughter. Out of anger he banishes you. So really, The Wizard and The Princess 
 lived happily ever after.  The End.
