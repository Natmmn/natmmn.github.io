 <p>You take the "Forest of Doom" route and bump into a bear. 
 The bear bites your map and you run through all the trees, as you turn around
 to see if it is still chasing you, you run into a tree, blacking out.  You 
 wake up the next morning with a bump on your head and no map, you proceed down
 the path you originally took until you come across a fork in the road, which 
 will you chose?
