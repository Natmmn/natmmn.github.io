     <h1>Project 1 | Remix Montage</h1>
     

     <p>Artist Statement: My montage's concept is about the lack of privacy in social media today.  Everyone, friends and strangers alike, know your location, 
     even when a persons location is private, they still know where you are at.  This is a scary concept, but I wanted to portray it in a fun and colorful way 
     because that is how snapchat, and any other social networking sites, convey it as.
