     <h1>Project 2 | Animation with Sound</h1>

     <p>Artist Statement: An animated version of my "Remix Monatage", showing how social media
     now a days is lacking in privacy. Everyone can figure out where you are on a map, even
     people who are on "Ghost Mode". This is a scary topic and I created it in a fun-colorful
     way because that is exactly how Snapchat portrays it as.  The sound I added in helps convey 
     my concept by letting people know where to look first.
